# carousel
In this repository I've made a carousel component using a React core library (without CRA) and webpack setup environment.

After cloning this project you can test it in the "dist" folder where you need to open an index.html file.
Or after installing necessary dependencies through "npm install", you can run command "npm start" to serve this project on your local host.

With this carousel you can scroll a list by horizontal view with SMB (Scroll Mouse Button) on Desktop.
On mobile version you have a swipe function which you can gracefully leaf through all this superbikes.
In addition, on the bottom of the screen you have a select option with names to find out how those bikes looks like.

I've decided to present a greatest motorbikes of 2021 which you may like it.

Images references I've used from Google search for studing purpous.
